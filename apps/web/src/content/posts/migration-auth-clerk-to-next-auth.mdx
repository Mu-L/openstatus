We recently switched from Clerk to Next Auth (Auth.js) for our authentication.
Now, let's explore the reasons for this decision.

## Why did we wanted to migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js)? ü§î

First Clerk is an amazing product. But we are building an open-source project
and creating an account on Clerk, setting up social login, and routing the
webhook to localhost was a pain for new contributors.

We want to improve the contributor experience for OpenStatus, making
contributions easier.

Our efforts have already simplified the process significantly.

## Why did we started with Clerk? üßë‚Äçüíª

When we started OpenStatus, we needed a way to authenticate users. We wanted to
make it easy for users to sign up and log in to our platform.

Clerk was a good choice for us because it provided a simple way to authenticate
users.

The documentation was clear, and the setup was straightforward. It was working
flawlessly with nextjs app router.

At the same time NextAuth was starting a transition to Auth.js. We didn't want
to go with Next-auth v4 as it was probably nearing the end of its life. Also the
docs for next-auth v4 were a bit confusing.

With all these reasons, we decided to go with Clerk.

## Why did we pick NextAuth (Auth.js) and not Lucia? üîë

First when we thought about migrating from Clerk, we thought about
[Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/). Lucia is an amazing authentication library
that is gaining popularity built by [Pilcrow](https://pilcrowonpaper.com/).

We were scared about the stability and direction of the project. When you
implement authentication you want to do it once and forget about it after.

We decided to go with NextAuth because it was more mature also it seemed more
stable to us.

We also both had some experience with NextAuth. It was a good choice for us as
we did not have to learn a new library.

## How did we migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js)? üöÄ

We were scared of the migration at first. We thought it would be a long and
hard. But the migration was quite simple. As we were already storing most of the
user data in our database.

We had to create two new tables in our database for sessions and accounts. For
existing user we only create an account when they logged back.

We had to use our custom authentication UI components instead of Clerk's,
removing Clerk branding from the OpenStatus login page.

We still have some issue with types and NextAuth. We have an
[open issue](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/issues/812) if you want
to help us ü§ó.

## Conclusion

If you are building an open-source project, we recommend NextAuth. But if it's a
closed source SaaS project, Clerk is a good choice.

We are happy with our decision to migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js).
While we will miss some Clerk features (analytics), we look forward to exploring
what NextAuth offers us.
