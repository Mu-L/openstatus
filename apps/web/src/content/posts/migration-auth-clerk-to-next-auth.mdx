We just migrated from Clerk to Next Auth (Auth.js) for our authentication. Let's
dive into the reasons behind this decision.

## Why did we wanted to migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js)?

First Clerk is an amazing product. But we are building an open-source project
and it was painful to have to ask for our new contributors to create an account
on Clerk. Then setup some social login and then route the webhook to their
localhost.

We really want to improve the DX of our contributors. We want to make it as easy
to contribute to OpenStatus as possible.

## Why did we started with Clerk ?

When we started OpenStatus, we needed a way to authenticate users. We wanted to
make it easy for users to sign up and log in to our platform.

Clerk was a good choice for us because it provided a simple way to authenticate
users.

The documentation was clear, and the setup was straightforward. It was working
flawlessly with nextjs app router.

At the same time NextAuth was starting a transition to Auth.js. We didn't want
to go with Next-auth v4 as it was probably near the end of its life. Also the
docs for next-auth v4 were a bit confusing.

With all these reasons, we decided to go with Clerk.

## Why did we pick NextAuth (Auth.js) and not Lucia?

First when we thought about migrating from Clerk, we thought about
[Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/). Lucia is an amazing authentication library
that is gaining popularity built by [Pilcrow](https://pilcrowonpaper.com/).

But we decided to go with NextAuth because it was more mature also it seemed
more stable to us.

We also both had some experience with NextAuth. It was a good choice for us as
we did not have to learn a new library.

## How did we migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js)?

We were scared of the migration at first. We thought it would be a long and
hard. But the migration was quite simple. As we were already storing most of the
user data in our database.

## Conclusion

We are happy with our decision to migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js).
Though we are going to miss some Clerk features, we are excited to see what
NextAuth has in store for us.
