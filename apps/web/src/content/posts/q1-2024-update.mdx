A lot has happened in the first quarter of 2024. We have been working hard to
improve OpenStatus and make it the best platform for monitoring the performance
of your services.

## Metrics

Our MRR has increased by 108% compared to the last quarter of 2023.

We grew our user base by 38% and now have over 3000 users on the platform.

## Product Updates

We have shipped a lot of new features in the first quarter of 2024, just to name
a few:

- Terraform Providers
- Request Assertion

But you should check out our [changelog](/changelog) for a complete list of
updates.

## Team Update

Thibault went full time on OpenStatus in March 2024.

## What to expect for the next quarter?

We are slowly rolling out Real User Monitoring (RUM) to all users. We are also
planing on making the platform more easily self hosted.

We want to be the best platform for monitoring the performance of your services.
