faq:
  - question: "What is the best open-source status page tool in 2026?"
    answer: "openstatus is the top pick for 2026. It is actively maintained, offers both cloud-hosted and self-hosted deployments, includes built-in uptime monitoring, and integrates with Slack out of the box."
  - question: "What should I look for when choosing an open-source status page?"
    answer: "Focus on active maintenance, deployment flexibility (hosted vs. self-hosted), built-in monitoring, notification integrations (Slack, email, webhooks), and how easy it is for your end users to understand the current status at a glance."
  - question: "Can I self-host an open-source status page for free?"
    answer: "Yes. Tools like openstatus, Vigil, Cachet, and Statping-ng can all be self-hosted at no licensing cost. Keep in mind you will still need to provision and maintain your own infrastructure, so factor in server and operational costs."
  - question: "Is Upptime still a good choice in 2026?"
    answer: "Upptime pioneered a clever GitOps approach using GitHub Actions and Pages, but its last major release was in 2020. Because it is no longer actively maintained, we recommend choosing an actively developed alternative like OpenStatus for production use."

# The State of Open-Source Status Pages in 2026: What Are Your Best Options?

If there’s one thing we’ve learned in DevRel and platform engineering, it’s that **downtime is inevitable, but poor communication is a choice.** When your API goes down or latency spikes, your users shouldn't have to guess what's happening. A reliable, transparent status page is your frontline for maintaining developer trust.

But building a status page from scratch in 2026 is usually a waste of valuable engineering cycles. Instead, the open-source community has provided several excellent tools to do the heavy lifting for us.

we’ve reviewed the current landscape of open-source status pages. Here is a breakdown of the top contenders this year, where they shine, and where they fall short.

---

### 1. Openstatus: The Modern MVP

**Best for:** Teams looking for a modern, actively maintained, and feature-rich solution.

If you want a tool that feels like it belongs in a modern 2026 stack, **openstatus** is currently leading the pack. It is fully open-source and provides the flexibility of both cloud-hosted and self-hosted deployments.

The maintainers are highly active, and it goes beyond just displaying a static page. It includes built-in uptime monitoring and a very handy Slack agent, meaning your on-call team and your users stay in sync automatically.

- **Pros:** Actively maintained, hosted/self-hosted flexibility, built-in monitoring, seamless Slack integration.
- **Cons:** None that immediately stand out for standard use cases.

### 2. Cachet: The Sleeping Giant

**Best for:** Existing enterprise users willing to wait for the next generation.

Cachet has historically been a massive name in the open-source status page space. It remains actively maintained by a dedicated core team, but it is currently in a transitional phase.

The last official release was back in 2023, which might raise eyebrows for new adopters. However, this is because the team is heads-down rebuilding the platform from the ground up for **Version 3.0**. If you are looking for a mature tool with a rich history, keep an eye on Cachet—but you might want to hold off on a fresh deployment until 3.0 officially drops.

- **Pros:** Proven track record, great community, highly anticipated v3.0 on the horizon.
- **Cons:** Stale current release (last updated 2023).

### 3. Vigil: The Lightweight Rust Option

**Best for:** Infrastructure teams managing microservices who love self-hosting.

Written entirely in Rust, **Vigil** is a specialized, high-performance status page designed specifically for microservice architectures.

It handles its own monitoring and is incredibly lightweight, but it comes with a catch: it is strictly self-hosted. There is no managed cloud option here. If you have the infrastructure chops and want a blazingly fast, standalone binary monitoring your nodes, Vigil is a fantastic choice.

- **Pros:** Written in Rust (fast, memory-safe), built for microservices, includes monitoring.
- **Cons:** Self-hosted only, requires infrastructure overhead to manage.

### 4. Statping-ng: Function Over Form

**Best for:** Hackers and sysadmins who just need it to work.

**Statping.ng** is an all-in-one solution that provides both underlying monitoring and a public-facing status page. It is robust and gets the job done without much fuss.

However, in a world where developer experience (DX) and user interfaces matter more than ever, Statping-ng shows its age. The UI feels noticeably outdated compared to newer players like openstatus. If you don't care about aesthetics and just want raw functionality, it’s a viable pick.

- **Pros:** All-in-one monitoring and status reporting, reliable.
- **Cons:** The UI/UX feels stuck in the past.

### 5. Upptime: The GitOps Pioneer

**Best for:** Legacy projects looking for a zero-server setup (with caveats).

Upptime brought a brilliant concept to the table: using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages to run an entirely free, serverless status page.

Unfortunately, as of 2026, the project seems to have stalled. With its last major release way back in October 2020, it is no longer actively maintained. While it’s a cool showcase of GitOps, relying on unmaintained software for your incident communication is a risky move I can't confidently recommend for new production environments.

- **Pros:** Completely free, brilliant use of GitHub Actions/Pages.
- **Cons:** Abandoned (no updates since 2020), not actively maintained.

### Summary Comparison

| Tool            | Active in 2026? | Deployment           | Built-in Monitoring | Standout Feature                  |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| **Openstatus**  | ✅ Yes          | Hosted & Self-Hosted | ✅ Yes              | Slack Agent integration           |
| **Vigil**       | ✅ Yes          | Self-Hosted Only     | ✅ Yes              | Rust-based microservice focus     |
| **Cachet**      | ⚠️ Rebuilding   | Self-Hosted          | ❌ No               | Massive community (awaiting v3.0) |
| **Statping.ng** | ✅ Yes          | Self-Hosted          | ✅ Yes              | All-in-one, but outdated UI       |
| **Upptime**     | ❌ No           | GitHub Actions       | ✅ Yes              | Zero-server GitOps                |

### The Verdict

If you are starting a new project or migrating an old status page today, **openstatus** is the clear winner. Its modern architecture, active maintenance, and built-in integrations make it the easiest way to keep your users informed while your engineering team focuses on fixing the actual outages.
