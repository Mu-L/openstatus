Meet the OpenStatus Slack agent — manage your incidents without leaving Slack.

Mention `@openstatus` in any channel to create, update, and resolve incidents or schedule maintenance windows. Your status page and subscribers stay in sync automatically.

Here's what you can do:

- **Create incidents** — `@openstatus create an incident for the payment API – high latency detected.`
- **Update incidents** — `@openstatus keep the status page updated that we are still monitoring the issue.`
- **Resolve incidents** — `@openstatus resolve the ongoing incident on my API status page.`
- **Schedule maintenance** — `@openstatus schedule a maintenance window for my database next Friday from 2–3 PM.`

Head to **Settings > Integrations** in your dashboard to install the Slack agent.
