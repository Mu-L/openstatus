category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good BetterStack alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. openstatus offers uptime monitoring from 28 regions (vs. BetterStack's 4), an open-source codebase, parallel check scheduling, and unlimited status page subscribers — all included in the base price. BetterStack charges extra for private status pages ($42/mo.) and subscriber tiers ($42/mo. per 1000). openstatus is also bootstrapped and self-hostable."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to BetterStack?"
    answer: "openstatus starts free (Hobby plan) and paid plans begin at $30/month (Starter) and $100/month (Pro). Private status pages and unlimited subscribers are included. BetterStack's equivalent features require paid add-ons on top of their base price."
  - question: "Does openstatus support more monitoring regions than BetterStack?"
    answer: "openstatus monitors from 28 regions worldwide across 3 cloud providers. BetterStack uses approximately 4 regions. openstatus also uses a parallel scheduling strategy — all selected regions fire simultaneously — whereas BetterStack uses round-robin scheduling, cycling through regions one at a time."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus instead of using the cloud service?"
    answer: "Yes. openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0 license) and fully self-hostable with Docker. BetterStack is a closed-source SaaS product with no self-hosting option."
  - question: "What is the difference between parallel and round-robin monitoring?"
    answer: "Parallel monitoring (openstatus) checks all selected regions simultaneously at each interval, giving you a true global snapshot of availability. Round-robin monitoring (BetterStack) cycles through regions one at a time, so each check only tests from a single location. Parallel monitoring detects regional outages faster."

## Looking for a BetterStack alternative?

If you want more monitoring regions, transparent pricing, and no add-on fees, openstatus is the BetterStack alternative to consider. It checks from 28 regions in parallel (vs. BetterStack's 4 in round-robin), is fully open-source, and includes status pages and unlimited subscribers in the base price — no surprise charges.

Openstatus and BetterStack are both uptime monitoring platforms with status pages. Openstatus is open-source, bootstrapped, and built for teams that want global coverage and transparent pricing. BetterStack is a VC-backed, closed-source SaaS with a broader product suite including log management.

The most significant technical difference is scheduling strategy: openstatus checks all selected regions **simultaneously** (parallel), giving you a true global picture of availability at each check interval. BetterStack uses **round-robin** scheduling, cycling through regions one at a time.
