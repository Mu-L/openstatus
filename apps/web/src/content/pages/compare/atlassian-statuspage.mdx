category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Atlassian Statuspage alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes built-in uptime monitoring from 28 global regions — something Atlassian Statuspage does not offer at all. Openstatus pricing is flat ($30/mo) and does not scale with subscriber count. Atlassian Statuspage charges per subscriber tier, meaning your bill grows as your audience does. Openstatus is also open-source and self-hostable."
  - question: "Does openstatus include uptime monitoring unlike Atlassian Statuspage?"
    answer: "Yes. Atlassian Statuspage has no built-in monitoring. You must connect a separate tool (Datadog, Pingdom, etc.) to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints from 28 regions simultaneously and can update your status page automatically based on check results."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to Atlassian Statuspage?"
    answer: "Atlassian Statuspage starts at $29/month for one page and 100 subscribers, jumping to $99/month for three pages and $399/month for custom HTML/CSS. Subscriber-count tiers add cost as your audience grows. Openstatus starts at $30/month with flat pricing, unlimited subscribers, and monitoring included."
  - question: "What does the OpsGenie shutdown mean for Statuspage users?"
    answer: "OpsGenie, Atlassian's incident management tool often used alongside Statuspage, is shutting down in April 2027. Teams using the Statuspage + OpsGenie combination will need to find replacements for both. Openstatus covers the monitoring and status page layer in one product."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0) and fully self-hostable. Atlassian Statuspage is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

## Looking for an Atlassian Statuspage alternative?

**TL;DR:** Atlassian Statuspage has no built-in monitoring, charges per subscriber tier, and gates custom styling behind a $399/month plan. Openstatus includes monitoring from 28 regions, flat pricing with unlimited subscribers, and is fully open-source. With OpsGenie shutting down in 2027, now is a good time to simplify your stack.

If you're paying for Statuspage and a separate monitoring tool on top of it, openstatus replaces both. It includes uptime monitoring from 28 global regions and a native status page in one product — with flat pricing that doesn't scale with your subscriber count. Plus, with OpsGenie shutting down in 2027, now is a good time to simplify your stack.

Atlassian Statuspage is the longest-established name in status pages, but it comes with significant trade-offs: **no built-in monitoring**, pricing that scales with your subscriber count, and customization gated behind its most expensive tier. Openstatus covers monitoring and status pages in one product at a fraction of the cost, with flat pricing and an open-source codebase.

The most important structural difference: Atlassian Statuspage requires you to connect a separate monitoring tool (Datadog, Pingdom, New Relic) to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints directly from 28 regions and updates your status page automatically — no second tool, no manual webhook wiring.

Additionally, OpsGenie — Atlassian's incident management product often used alongside Statuspage — is shutting down in April 2027.

## Pricing Comparison

|                     | openstatus       | Atlassian Statuspage        |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Starting price      | $30/mo           | $29/mo                      |
| Monitoring included | Yes (28 regions) | No (requires separate tool) |
| Status pages        | 1 (+$20/mo each) | 1                           |
| Subscribers         | Unlimited        | 100 (scales with cost)      |
| Custom Themes       | Included         | $399/mo plan                |
| Team members        | Unlimited        | Restricted                  |
| 3 status pages      | $70/mo           | $99/mo                      |

The starting prices look similar, but Atlassian Statuspage's $29/month plan only includes 100 subscribers and no monitoring. To get custom styling, you need the $399/month plan. And you still need to pay for a separate monitoring tool on top of that. Openstatus includes monitoring, unlimited subscribers, and theming from $30/month.

## When to Choose openstatus

- You want **monitoring + status page** in a single product without wiring up a second tool
- You need **flat, predictable pricing** that does not scale with subscriber count
- You want **open-source** software or need to self-host
- You are not locked into the Atlassian ecosystem (Jira, Confluence)
- You need **monitoring-as-code**, OpenTelemetry export, or CI/CD integration

## When to Choose Atlassian Statuspage

- Your organization is deeply embedded in the **Atlassian ecosystem** and requires native Jira integration
- You need enterprise **subscriber management at very large scale** with Atlassian's compliance certifications
- Your contracts or procurement processes are already tied to **Atlassian Enterprise agreements**

## Switching from Atlassian Statuspage to openstatus

Atlassian Statuspage is one of the most common platforms teams switch from. Here's the migration path:

1. **Sign up** for a free openstatus account — no credit card required
2. **Recreate your components** — set up the same service components you had on Statuspage
3. **Create monitors** — add HTTP, TCP, or DNS monitors for each component. Unlike Statuspage, openstatus detects incidents automatically from 28 regions — no need for a separate Datadog or Pingdom integration
4. **Set up your status page** — configure custom domain, branding, maintenance windows, and subscriber notifications
5. **Configure alerts** — openstatus supports Slack, Discord, Email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana OnCall, and more
6. **Update your DNS** — point your custom status page domain to openstatus
7. **Notify subscribers** — let your status page subscribers know about any URL changes
8. **Cancel Statuspage + monitoring tool** — since openstatus includes monitoring, you can cancel both your Statuspage subscription and the separate monitoring service

With OpsGenie shutting down in April 2027, this is also a good time to consolidate your incident detection and communication into a single tool.
