category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Uptime Kuma alternative?"
    answer: "Yes, especially if you want managed cloud hosting or global multi-region monitoring. Both are open-source, but openstatus is available as a SaaS (no server to maintain) and monitors from 28 regions worldwide. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only and checks from a single server location."
  - question: "What is the main difference between openstatus and Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "The main difference is hosting model and monitoring coverage. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only — you run it on your own server and it monitors from that single location. openstatus is available as a managed SaaS or self-hosted, and checks from 28 regions across multiple cloud providers simultaneously."
  - question: "Is openstatus free like Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "openstatus has a free Hobby plan (1 monitor, 6 regions, 1 status page) with no credit card required. Uptime Kuma is fully free and open-source but requires you to provision, host, and maintain your own server."
  - question: "Does openstatus support self-hosting like Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "Yes. openstatus is AGPL-3.0 licensed and can be self-hosted with Docker. You also get the option to use the managed cloud service without managing any infrastructure."
  - question: "Can openstatus monitor from multiple regions unlike Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "Yes. openstatus monitors from 28 regions across 3 cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Fly.io) simultaneously. Uptime Kuma only checks from the single server where it is installed, which means it cannot detect regional outages."

## Looking for an Uptime Kuma alternative?

**TL;DR:** Both are open-source. Openstatus offers managed SaaS hosting and monitors from 28 global regions simultaneously. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only and checks from one server location. Choose openstatus for global coverage without infrastructure, Uptime Kuma for fully free self-managed monitoring.

If you love the open-source ethos of Uptime Kuma but want managed hosting and global coverage, openstatus gives you both. Monitor from 28 regions across 3 cloud providers without maintaining your own server — or self-host it if you prefer. Either way, you get multi-region checks that Uptime Kuma's single-server architecture can't provide.

Openstatus and Uptime Kuma are both open-source uptime monitoring tools, making this a comparison between two projects with shared values but different architectures. The fundamental difference is the **hosting model**: Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only — you run it on your own server and it monitors from that single location. Openstatus is available both as a **managed SaaS** and for self-hosting, and checks from **28 regions worldwide**.

If you want zero infrastructure responsibility and global multi-region checks, openstatus is the natural choice. If you want a completely free, self-managed tool with full control and no external dependencies, Uptime Kuma is a solid option.

Uptime Kuma is free software, but running it requires a server. A basic VPS costs $5-20/month, and you're responsible for updates, backups, and keeping the monitoring server itself online. Openstatus's managed SaaS eliminates that overhead. To get multi-region monitoring with Uptime Kuma, you'd need to run separate instances in each region.

## When to Choose openstatus

- You want **managed SaaS** with no infrastructure to maintain
- You need **28-region global monitoring** from multiple cloud providers
- You want **monitoring as code** via YAML and GitHub Actions
- You need **OpenTelemetry export** or a tightly integrated status page
- You want to **talk to the founders** directly (bootstrapped, small team)

## When to Choose Uptime Kuma

- You want **completely free** monitoring with no usage limits
- You are comfortable **running your own server**
- You need monitoring **behind a firewall** with no external SaaS dependency
- You prefer a **single-location** check from your own infrastructure

## Switching from Uptime Kuma to openstatus

1. **Sign up** for a free openstatus account — no credit card required
2. **Recreate your monitors** — use the dashboard or monitoring-as-code (YAML + CLI) to define your HTTP, TCP, and DNS checks
3. **Set up your status page** — openstatus includes a branded status page with custom domain support
4. **Configure alerts** — openstatus supports Slack, Discord, Email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, and more
5. **Decommission your server** — once your monitors are running on openstatus, you can shut down your Uptime Kuma instance and stop paying for the VPS

If you prefer to self-host openstatus instead, check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus) for Docker setup instructions.
