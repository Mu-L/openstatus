category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Uptime Kuma alternative?"
    answer: "Yes, especially if you want managed cloud hosting or global multi-region monitoring. Both are open-source, but openstatus is available as a SaaS (no server to maintain) and monitors from 28 regions worldwide. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only and checks from a single server location."
  - question: "What is the main difference between openstatus and Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "The main difference is hosting model and monitoring coverage. Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only — you run it on your own server and it monitors from that single location. openstatus is available as a managed SaaS or self-hosted, and checks from 28 regions across multiple cloud providers simultaneously."
  - question: "Is openstatus free like Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "openstatus has a free Hobby plan (1 monitor, 6 regions, 1 status page) with no credit card required. Uptime Kuma is fully free and open-source but requires you to provision, host, and maintain your own server."
  - question: "Does openstatus support self-hosting like Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "Yes. openstatus is AGPL-3.0 licensed and can be self-hosted with Docker. You also get the option to use the managed cloud service without managing any infrastructure."
  - question: "Can openstatus monitor from multiple regions unlike Uptime Kuma?"
    answer: "Yes. openstatus monitors from 28 regions across 3 cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Fly.io) simultaneously. Uptime Kuma only checks from the single server where it is installed, which means it cannot detect regional outages."

Openstatus and Uptime Kuma are both open-source uptime monitoring tools, making this a comparison between two projects with shared values but different architectures. The fundamental difference is the **hosting model**: Uptime Kuma is self-hosted only — you run it on your own server and it monitors from that single location. Openstatus is available both as a **managed SaaS** and for self-hosting, and checks from **28 regions worldwide**.

If you want zero infrastructure responsibility and global multi-region checks, openstatus is the natural choice. If you want a completely free, self-managed tool with full control and no external dependencies, Uptime Kuma is a solid option.

## When to Choose Uptime Kuma

- You are comfortable **running your own server**
- You need monitoring **behind a firewall** with no external SaaS dependency
- You prefer a **single-location** check from your own infrastructure
