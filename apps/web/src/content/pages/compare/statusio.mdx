faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Status.io alternative?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes built-in uptime monitoring from 28 global regions, which Status.io does not offer. Openstatus is open-source, self-hostable, and starts at $30/month with unlimited team members. Status.io is a closed-source SaaS starting around $79/month with no monitoring capabilities."
  - question: "Does openstatus include uptime monitoring unlike Status.io?"
    answer: "Yes. Status.io is a hosted status page platform with no built-in monitoring. You still need a separate tool to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints from 28 regions simultaneously and can reflect real check results on your status page."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to Status.io?"
    answer: "Status.io starts around $79/month. Openstatus starts at $30/month and includes uptime monitoring, unlimited team members, and developer tooling (CLI, Terraform, GitHub Actions) that Status.io does not offer."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus like I cannot with Status.io?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0) and fully self-hostable. Status.io is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

## Looking for a Status.io alternative?

**TL;DR:** Status.io costs $79+/month for a status page with no monitoring included. Openstatus starts at $30/month and includes uptime monitoring from 28 regions, unlimited team members, and developer tooling — all in one open-source product.

If you're paying $79+/month for a status page that doesn't even include monitoring, openstatus is the alternative that covers both. Get uptime monitoring from 28 global regions and a native status page in one open-source product starting at $30/month with unlimited team members.

Openstatus and Status.io are both hosted status page platforms, but they differ significantly in scope and price. Status.io is an older, enterprise-oriented status page tool with no built-in monitoring — you need a separate service to detect incidents. Openstatus monitors your endpoints from **28 regions simultaneously**, surfaces results on a native status page, and provides developer tooling (CLI, Terraform, GitHub Actions) that Status.io does not.

For teams that want monitoring and status pages without stitching together two products, openstatus covers both at a lower price point with an open-source codebase.

## Pricing Comparison

|                     | openstatus                        | Status.io              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Starting price      | $30/mo                            | ~$79/mo                |
| What's included     | Monitoring + status page + alerts | Status page only       |
| Monitoring          | Built-in (28 regions)             | Requires separate tool |
| Team members        | Unlimited on paid plans           | Limited by plan        |
| Developer tooling   | CLI, Terraform, GitHub Actions    | No                     |
| Self-hosting option | Yes (free)                        | No                     |

Status.io costs nearly 3x more than openstatus's Starter plan — and doesn't include any monitoring. When you factor in the cost of a separate monitoring tool, the total cost difference grows even larger.
