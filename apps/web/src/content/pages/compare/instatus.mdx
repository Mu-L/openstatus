category: "company"
faq:
  - question: "Is openstatus a good Instatus alternative?"
    answer: "Yes, especially if you need real uptime monitoring alongside your status page. Instatus is a status-page-first product with basic HTTP monitoring added later. Openstatus was built around monitoring first — checking from 28 global regions simultaneously — with status pages as a native part of the product, not a bolt-on."
  - question: "Does openstatus include a status page like Instatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus includes branded status pages with custom domains, maintenance windows, and subscriber notifications on all paid plans. The status page is tightly coupled to your monitors, so incidents and response times reflect real check results."
  - question: "How does openstatus pricing compare to Instatus?"
    answer: "Instatus starts at $20/month for one custom-domain status page. Openstatus starts at $30/month and includes uptime monitoring from 28 regions, unlimited team members, and monitoring-as-code tooling. If you need both monitoring and a status page, openstatus covers both in one plan."
  - question: "Can I self-host openstatus?"
    answer: "Yes. Openstatus is open-source (AGPL-3.0) and fully self-hostable. Instatus is a closed-source SaaS with no self-hosting option."

## Looking for an Instatus alternative?

**TL;DR:** Instatus is a status-page-first product with basic monitoring bolted on. Openstatus was built around monitoring — 28 regions, parallel checks — with status pages as a native part of the product. If you want your status page backed by real monitoring data, choose openstatus.

If you want your status page backed by real monitoring — not just a pretty page with bolted-on HTTP pings — openstatus is the stronger choice. It monitors from 28 regions simultaneously and surfaces results directly on your status page, so incidents are detected and communicated automatically.

Openstatus and Instatus are both alternatives to Atlassian Statuspage, but they cover different ground. Instatus is focused purely on status pages — fast, CDN-delivered, with basic monitoring bolted on as a secondary feature. Openstatus treats **monitoring and status pages as equal parts of the same product**: checks run from 28 regions simultaneously, and your status page reflects those results in real time.

The practical difference: with Instatus, your status page and your monitoring live in separate worlds. With openstatus, an incident detected by a monitor can surface directly on your status page — no manual update, no webhook wiring between tools.

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Free plan               | 1 monitor, 1 status page                                        | 1 status page (no custom domain)               |
| Starter/paid            | $30/mo                                                          | $20/mo                                         |
| What's included         | 20 monitors + 28 regions + status page + unlimited team members | 1 custom-domain status page + basic monitoring |
| Additional status pages | $20/mo each                                                     | Included in higher plans                       |

Instatus is $10/month cheaper on the base plan, but it does not include the depth of monitoring openstatus offers. If you're already paying for a separate monitoring tool alongside Instatus, openstatus replaces both at a lower combined cost.

## When to Choose openstatus

- You need **uptime monitoring** tightly integrated with your status page
- You want **28-region parallel checks** rather than basic single-location HTTP pings
- You need **monitoring-as-code** via YAML, CLI, Terraform, or GitHub Actions
- You prefer **open-source** software or need to self-host
- You want **OpenTelemetry export** to push check results into your existing observability stack

## When to Choose Instatus

- You want a **pure status page** with no monitoring requirements
- You need a **static, CDN-delivered** status page with fast global load times
- You are migrating from Atlassian Statuspage and monitoring is handled by a separate tool
- You want the **lowest possible price** for a standalone status page
