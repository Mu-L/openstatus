## Looking for an UptimeRobot alternative?

**TL;DR:** Openstatus monitors from 28 regions simultaneously with open-source code and unlimited team members. UptimeRobot checks from one location at a time and charges $19/seat for team access.

If you're tired of single-location checks and per-seat pricing, openstatus is the UptimeRobot alternative worth considering. It's open-source, monitors from 28 regions simultaneously, includes unlimited team members on paid plans, and gives you a built-in status page — all things UptimeRobot doesn't offer.

Openstatus and UptimeRobot are both uptime monitoring tools, but they differ significantly in architecture and capabilities. Openstatus is open-source, monitors from 28 regions **simultaneously**, and includes status pages and developer tooling. UptimeRobot is a long-established closed-source SaaS that checks from a single location at a time with a simpler feature set.

For teams that need global monitoring coverage, CI/CD integration, or a public status page, openstatus is the stronger choice. UptimeRobot remains a simple, well-known option for basic single-location availability checks.

| Multi-cloud        | 3 providers      | No              |
| Multi-region       | 28 regions       | Single location |
| OTel Export        | Yes              | No              |
| GitHub Action      | Yes              | No              |
| Team members       | Unlimited (paid) | $19/seat add-on |
| Status Page        | Yes              | Basic           |
| Monitoring as code | Yes              | No              |
| Self-hostable      | Yes              | No              |

## Pricing Comparison

|              | openstatus              | UptimeRobot           |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Free plan    | 1 monitor, 6 regions    | 50 monitors, 1 region |
| Starter/paid | $30/mo (20 monitors)    | $8/mo per 10 monitors |
| Team members | Unlimited on paid plans | $19/seat add-on       |
| Status page  | Included                | Included (basic)      |
| Multi-region | Included (28 regions)   | Not available         |

UptimeRobot's free plan includes more monitors, but openstatus's free plan already includes multi-region monitoring. On paid plans, UptimeRobot's per-seat pricing adds up quickly for teams — a 5-person team adds $95/month on top of the monitoring cost.
