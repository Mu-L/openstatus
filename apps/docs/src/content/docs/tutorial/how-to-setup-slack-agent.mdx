## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to install the OpenStatus Slack agent so you can manage incidents directly from your Slack workspace — no need to switch to the dashboard.

### Prerequisites

- An OpenStatus account ([openstatus.dev](https://www.openstatus.dev))
- A Slack workspace where you have permission to install apps

### What you'll get

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- The OpenStatus Slack agent installed in your workspace
- The ability to create, update, and resolve incidents from Slack

## Install the Slack Agent

### 1. Go to Settings

Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** in your OpenStatus dashboard.

### 2. Install the Slack Integration

Click the **Install Slack** button. You'll be redirected to Slack's authorization page where you can select the workspace and channel you want to connect.

Grant the requested permissions and click **Allow** to complete the installation.

<Aside>Make sure you select the correct Slack workspace if you belong to multiple workspaces.</Aside>

### 3. Start Managing Incidents from Slack

Once installed, mention **@openstatus** in any channel to interact with the agent. This keeps threads clean — the bot only responds when mentioned.

Here are some examples:

#### Create an incident

Notify your subscribers about a new issue.

```
@openstatus create an incident for the payment API – high latency detected.
```

#### Update an incident

Keep your status page updated while you investigate.

```
@openstatus keep the status page updated that we are still monitoring the issue.
```

#### Resolve an incident

Close an active incident and let your subscribers know.

```
@openstatus resolve the ongoing incident on my API status page.
```

#### Schedule maintenance

Plan downtime so subscribers are informed in advance.

```
@openstatus schedule a maintenance window for my database next Friday from 2–3 PM.
```
