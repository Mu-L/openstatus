## Introduction

In this guide, we will show you how to deploy your own status page to Cloudflare Pages using OpenStatus monitoring data.

For the Status Page, we will use [Astro](https://astro.build/), a new web framework. That allows you to build faster websites with less JavaScript.

The code showcased in this guide is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/astro-status-page)

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare Account.
- An [OpenStatus](https://www.openstatus.dev) Account.

## Get your monitoring data


To get your monitoring data, you need to create a monitor on OpenStatus.

We will use the OpenStatus API to get the monitor data.

Create your API key

## Deploy your status page

To deploy your status page, you need to create a new Cloudflare Pages project.

We are going to deploy a simple astro status page that shows the status of your endpoint.
